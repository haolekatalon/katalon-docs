Katalon Runtime Engine (KRE) is the test execution add-on of Katalon Studio. While the KSE license only supports you in generating test scripts and manually executing tests via the graphical user interface, the KRE license allows you to execute automated tests in CI/CD pipelines or via the command-line interface (CLI).

When running via CLI, one working session accounts for one license. To learn more about the use cases of KRE, see [Introduction to Katalon Runtime Engine](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/intro-RE.html).

The table below provides information on the KRE floating license:
