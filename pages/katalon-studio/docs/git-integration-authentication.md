> Starting from **version 7.0.0**, Katalon Studio supports connecting to Git with SSH Keys.

> Known issues:
>
> * Currently, the Git integration in Katalon Studio supports SSH SHA-1, RSA-1024 and RSA-2048 private keys. Since GitHub has dropped the support for DSA and RSA SHA-1, you cannot integrate Katalon Studio with GitHub via SSH. You can still integrate Katalon Studio with other cloud-hosted services of Git, such as GitLab, BitBucket, and Microsoft Azure DevOps.
>
> * The workaround for this issue is to use:
>
>   * HTTPS protocol with GitHub personal access token. See [Connect to Git with HTTPS](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/git-integration.html#connect-to-git-with-https).
>   * Git with a terminal.
>   * 3rd party tools.

In Katalon Studio, you can generate and add SSH keys to SSH agents without coding. With SSH keys, you can clone your Katalon Studio Project from cloud-hosted services of Git and integrate them with Katalon Studio. Cloud-based Git services include:

* GitHub
* GitLab
* BitBucket
* Microsoft Azure DevOps

In this tutorial, you will learn how to generate SSH keys and clone a repository from cloud-hosted services of Git with an SSH protocol.

> Requirements:
>
> - An active Katalon Studio Enterprise license.
> - An existing cloud-based Git repository for your projects. You can download or clone our CI sample project from our Github repository: [CI sample](https://github.com/katalon-studio-samples/ci-samples).
> - An existing account for your Git repository of choice.
## Generate SSH keys

1. To configure options for SSH, in **Katalon Studio > Preferences**, go to **General > Network Connection > SSH2**.

2. Manage your SSH keys:

    In the **General** tab, you can manage your SSH home directory and which private key you are using.

    For example, the SSH is usually located at `:/Users/your_user_name/.ssh` or `C:\Users\your_user_name\.ssh`). The `.ssh` folder contains your SSH private and public keys, for example: `id_rsa` or `id_rsa.pub`.
    
    In the **Private keys** section, you can view or delete the old keys and only keep the ID key you use.

3. Generate new SSH keys:

    In the **Configuration options for SSH2** section, select the **Key Management** tab.

    You can check if you already have an existing SSH key by clicking **Load Existing Key**. This action opens your `.ssh` folder.

    <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/git-integration/load-existing-key.png" alt="load existing key" width=50%>

    To generate a new SSH key, select **Generate DSA Key** or **Generate RSA Key** and copy the generated key to your clipboard.

    <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/git-integration/generate-ssh-key.png" alt="rsa key" width=90%>

    You can also generate an RSA key with this command:

    `ssh-keygen -m PEM -t rsa -b 2048 -C "your_email@example.com"`

    > Notes:
    >
    > * Katalon Studio only supports `OpenSSL`, not `OpenSSH` formats.

4. Add your SSH key to the SSH agent:

    Enter the **Passphrase** or leave it empty, then click **Save Private Keys**. Enter the file name and click **Save**. A new private and a new public key are generated.

    > * You can read more about passphrases in this GitHub document: [Working with SSH key passphrases](https://help.github.com/en/articles/working-with-ssh-key-passphrases).

## Clone your Project with a SSH Protocol

First, you need to enable Git Integration. See [Configure Git Integration](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/git-integration.html#configure-git-integration).

After enabling Git Integration, you can clone an existing **Git repository** into a newly-created directory on the local machine.

> **How to get SSH Protocol?**
> 
> Go to your account on GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or Azure DevOps, then go to the repository you want to clone to Katalon Studio.
> Click **Clone** and select **SSH**, then copy the **SSH Protocol**.

1. In the main toolbar, click on the _Git_ icon and select **Clone Project**.

    <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/git-integration/image2017-2-22-143A13A12.png" alt="Clone Project" width=30%>

    The **Clone Git Repository** dialog is displayed. Enter a repository URL with SSH Protocol and click **Next**.

    <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/git-integration/ssh.png" alt="source git repository" width=70%>

2. Enter the passphrase, if any, then click **OK**. The **Branch Selection** screen appears.

    <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/git-integration/filled-passphrase.png" alt="Enter the passphrase" width=70%>

3. Choose the branches you wish to check out as local branches. Click **Next** to continue. The **Local Destination** appears.

    <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/git-integration/branch.png" alt="choose local branches" width=70%>

4. Specify the local location for cloning as well as the initial branch.

    <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/git-integration/local.png" alt="specify the local location for cloning" width=70%>

    - **Directory**: the local storage location you want to store your Git repository.
    - **Initial branch**: all selected branches from the previous step are displayed here. Select the branch to be used initially from this list.

5. Click **Finish** when you are done. Katalon Studio automatically opens your cloned project.

6. To verify settings, go to **Katalon Studio> Preferences > Team > Git > Configurations >  Repository Settings**. Ensure that the repository is selected correctly with the URL specified.

    <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/git-integration/verify.png" alt="verify settings" width=70%>

After successfully cloning your repositories, you can commit, pull, and push changes to the repositories from Katalon Studio. To learn more about how to integrate with Git, see [Git Integration](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/git-integration.html#commit).
