Katalon Studio provides a free Jira add-on to help create a seamless integration. This add-on gives you several benefits:

* Sync test cases written in Gherkin and test execution results; and query issues based on testing status.
* Dynamic perspectives and an insightful look at your automation testing data.
* Progress tracking for better test management.

> Requirements:
> * The **Katalon Studio and TestOps integration** plugin installed in Jira. You can download the plugin from the Atlassian Marketplace website here: [Katalon Studio and TestOps integration](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1217501/katalon-bdd-test-automation-for-jira?hosting=cloud&tab=overview).
> * Jira Integration with Katalon TestOps enabled. To enable Jira Integration with Katalon TestOps, follow the steps in this document: [TestOps - Jira Integration](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/kt-jira-config.html).

## Jira Server

> **Notes**:
>
> To add custom fields, you must have the Jira admin access.

This add-on adds a custom field type to Jira called the **Katalon Gherkin** custom field. This custom field lets you write descriptions for your test cases and stories in Gherkin syntax. Gherkin keywords such as _Given_, _When_, _Then_ will be highlighted automatically. 

To create the Katalon Gherkin custom field, please follow the instructions from the Atlassian document here: [Project screens, schemes and fields](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver071/project-screens-schemes-and-fields-802592517.html).

Once imported to Katalon Studio, the content of the Katalon Gherkin field is in the test cases description.

For more details, see above: [Jira Server](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/bdd-settings.html#jira-server).

## View Katalon Studio Test Execution Result on Jira

Once Jira is integrated with Katalon Studio and the add-on is enabled in Jira Cloud, a panel called TEST RESULT inside the issue page enables users to directly view the test result. In the new view of the issue page, just click **Test Result**. The result includes the execution status (PASSED, FAILED, INCOMPLETE, ERROR) and test artifact attachments (e.g., logs, screenshots, etc.).

> Note: In Katalon Studio, the test case imported from Jira should be executed in Test Suite to view the test result.
