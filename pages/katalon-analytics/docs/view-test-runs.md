The Test Runs Overview module provides you with an overview of execution trends. It also presents a profile coverage and shows you the platform coverage of test runs and test results.

This module highlights your testing activities with real-time data. The data is assembled into the following three components:
* Profile Coverage
* Execution Trend
* Platform Coverage
These components drive insights and assist you in the decision-making process of a product cycle.

## Profile Coverage
