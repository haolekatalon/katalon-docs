In Katalon Studio, you can import Preferences configurations of another Katalon Studio instance to reuse. This function is useful when you download a new version of Katalon Studio or you want to reuse the Preferences configurations of your project team.

> Tips:
>
> If you have more than one version of Katalon Studio on your machine, you might want to rename them with their version numbers. For example, Katalon Studio 7.8.0.

To import Preferences, do as follows:

1. Open Katalon Studio, then go to **File > Import Settings**. This action opens the **config** folder of your Katalon Studio instance.

2. Browse to the **config** folder of your preferred version. For example:

* macOS:

* Windows:

   You can also browse a **config** folder sent from other users.

3. Click **Open**. An **Info** dialog appears when the Preferences are successfully imported.

You can also upgrade Katalon Studio to the latest version by navigating to **Help > Check for Updates ...**. Upgrading in this way keeps your Preferences configuration unchanged.
