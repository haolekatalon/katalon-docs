Katalon TestOps automatically detects abnormal Web Services. This feature enhances failure detection.

Follow these steps:

1. Sign in to [Katalon TestOps](https://testops.katalon.io/login) and go to your Project.

2. Go to **Test Management** > **Web Services**, then select the **Anomalies** tab.

    You can view a list of API requests which have taken less or more time than usual to respond here.

    To export an API request as HAR, go to the detail page of each Web Service call.
