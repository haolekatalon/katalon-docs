## Query Parameters

> Only available for **RESTful** Web Service requests

Query parameters can be added to a REST request's URL to tailor and filter the response output. When you input a URL, Katalon Studio detects the query parameters (after the question mark `?`) and list them in the table for better management.

## Variables and Parameterizing Request Objects

> Available for both **RESTful** and **SOAP** Web Service requests

Katalon Studio provides the **Variables** section with both manual and scripting editors. By using variables in a request object, you can handle the dynamic values of an object's properties and have more control over them. You can add a new variable and declare its properties in the **Variables** tab. To call a variable in a Web Service object, use the **${variable_name}** syntax as a place holder in any of the supported locations. The values of the pre-defined variables are passed to their place holders, respectively, during runtime. It is called parameterization, and the approach is the same as [parameterizing a WebUI object](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/manage-web-test-object.html#parameterize-web-test-objects).

In the manual view of a test case, when you add a request object, the pre-defined variables are added **automatically**; hence, you don't need to define them again.

### For RESTful request

Katalon Studio supports calling the declared variables in the following places of a RESTful Web Service object.

* URL
* Query Parameters
* HTTP Header
* HTTP Body
* Verification

The screenshot below illustrates an example of using the '**status**' variable in a URL.

### For SOAP-based request

The following locations are where you can use the pre-defined variables:

* WSDL URL
* Service Endpoint (available from version 7.5.5)
* HTTP Header
* Request Message
* Verification

Below is an example of parameterizing the domain URL in a SOAP request's service endpoint.

## Add test requests to a test case

There are multiple ways to add a test request object to a test case Katalon Studio. You can call the web service requests in the Manual View (keywords test) or Script View (test scripts) of a test case, and verify the responses.
