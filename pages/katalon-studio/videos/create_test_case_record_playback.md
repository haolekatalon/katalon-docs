A quick guide to create test cases using the record and playback feature of Katalon Studio, a complete test automation tool, built on top of Selenium and Appium. Katalon Studio helps you start automation testing with the least effort and at no cost. 

> Download the latest version of Katalon Studio at [www.katalon.com](https://www.katalon.com).

Read the full guideline of the record and playback feature at [Record Web Utility](/x/BoIw).

Follow these steps to get started with the record and playback feature:

1. Create a test case: 
    
    In the **Test Explorer** section, right-click on the **Test Cases** folder and choose **New > Test Case**. Provide a name for your test case, then click **OK**. An empty test case is created.

2. On the main **Toolbar**, click on the _Record_ button. The **Record** dialog appears.

3. To start recording a test case, click on the **Record** button.

4. Execute all your test steps in the browser. Katalon Studio records all the actions you perform on the browser.

5. You can **Stop** or **Pause** recording if needed. When you are done with recording, click **OK** to save the recorded actions into Katalon Studio.

6. A dialog appears, asking you to save captured objects into the Object Repository of Katalon Studio. Click **OK** to continue.

    Recorded objects and actions are saved into the test case.

7. On the main **Toolbar**, click on the _Run_ button to execute your test. You can specify which browser to run your playback with by selecting it from the dropdown list.

> Notes: 
>
> The steps above only help you create and run a simple test case.
