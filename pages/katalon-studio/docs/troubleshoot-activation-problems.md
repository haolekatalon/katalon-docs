Time differences might affect the validation of licenses on the Katalon Server.

## Troubleshoot Common Issues

Here is the list of common issues when activating Katalon Studio and/or starting Katalon TestOps, followed by possible solutions:

**<details><summary>Cannot connect to Katalon TestOps server. Please check your Internet connection and try again (1).</summary>**

Double-check your Internet connection first.

If you still encounter this error after double-checking, replace the auto-filled Server URL with [https://testops.katalon.io](https://testops.katalon.io).

</details>

**<details><summary>Cannot connect to Katalon TestOps server. Please check your Internet connection and try again (2).</summary>**

This error message means that the application has failed to communicate with Katalon Server for activation.

Check your Internet connection and try again.

If you're behind a Proxy Server, before activating Katalon Studio, you need to configure the Authentication Proxy settings. At the bottom of the Activation dialog box, click **Configure Authentication Proxy**. See: [Configure Proxy for Authentication](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/configure-proxy.html).

**<details><summary>CAPTCHA required</summary>**

CAPTCHA is required when you enter incorrect passwords multiple times.

Log into [Katalon TestOps](https://testops.katalon.io) using that account and enter the captcha.

You can now activate Katalon Studio.

</details>

**<details><summary>License Quota exceeded</summary>**

This exception means that the number of licenses in use exceeds the total number of licenses available to your Organization.

This may cause [session termination](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/session-termination.html).

To ensure business continuity, we recommend you subscribe to more licenses.

</details>

**<details><summary>Machine Quota exceeded</summary>**

If the number of machines on which you're using Katalon Studio exceeds the number of licenses that you purchased, you have two options:

* Subscribe to more licenses to cover more machines and execution sessions. See [Upgrade Subscriptions](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/upgrade-subs.html).
* Remove the machines. See [Revoke and transfer a license](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/license-management.html#revoke#a#license).
