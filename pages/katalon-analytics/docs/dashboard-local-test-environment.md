The **Local Test Environment** dashboard allows you to check:

* The number of online and offline agents.
* The distribution of all agents by the operating system.

## Insights

With auto-distributed executions in Katalon TestOps, you can run tests in parallel. See: [Auto-distributed execution](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/auto-distributed-execution.html).

A test execution is distributed to an available and active agent, minimizing execution time. By knowing the number of offline agents (and in which operating system there are more inactive agents), you can find out which agents need more jobs, optimizing testing performance across all platforms by ensuring that all agents are executing tests.
