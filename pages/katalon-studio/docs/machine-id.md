## How Katalon generates a machine ID

Machine ID generated by Katalon is based on the hardware specifications and the user account logged into that machine at the time.

For example:

User A logs into machine A will have a machine ID X, while user B logs into machine A will have a machine ID Y. Hence, you might need 2 licenses for working in this case.

## View your machine ID

You can view your machine ID in Katalon Studio and in your terminal dialog when you run your test with Katalon Runtime Engine (KRE).

### In Katalon Studio

To view your machine ID in Katalon Studio, follow these steps:

1. Open Katalon Studio. In the toolbar, click on the _Profile_ button and select **Log out**. You will be logged out of your current account, and the **Katalon Studio Activation** dialog appears.

    > Notes:
    >
    > If this is your first time opening Katalon Studio, the **Katalon Studio Activation** automatically pops up.

2. In the **Katalon Studio Activation** log, you can view and copy your machine ID.

### With Katalon Runtime Engine

Running a test with KRE automatically fetches your machine ID to validate your license. You can view your machine ID information in the terminal.
