To speed up a test suite's execution, we recommend starting the application once in the first test case and resetting it in each remaining test case with the following snippet:

```groovy
import com.kms.katalon.core.mobile.keyword.internal.MobileDriverFactory
import io.appium.java_client.AppiumDriver
AppiumDriver driver = MobileDriverFactory.getDriver();
driver.resetApp()
```
