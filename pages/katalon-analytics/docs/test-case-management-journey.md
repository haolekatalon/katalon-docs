Katalon TestOps presents test cases in a folder-based view that mirrors the organization of your script repository.

This document navigates you to where test cases are stored and how they are presented in Katalon TestOps to help you manage test cases effectively.

## View test cases from script repositories

There are two ways to upload your test cases to Katalon TestOps:

* Upload tests from a Git repository (GitHub and Bitbucket). See: [Upload Test Scripts from a Git Repository](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/git-test-project.html).
* Upload tests to a script repository (as .zip file). See: [Upload Test Scripts to a Script Repository](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/code-repo.html).

Depending on the type of your script repository (Git or .zip file), you can read the relevant section below to find your tests cases and their execution data.

### View test cases uploaded from a Git repository

> Notes:
>
> Katalon TestOps supports Azure Repos, GitLab, GitHub and Bitbucket.

After uploading your test scripts from a Git repository, go to **Test Management** > **Test Cases**.

The **Test Cases** page appears.

Here you can see all test case folders (corresponding to your Git repositories) display below the *Uploaded Data* folder.

> Notes:
>
> It may take a few minutes for the uploaded test cases to appear on the **Test Cases** page.

If you have not run tests yet, the execution data (**Last executed**, **Average Duration**, **Flakiness (%)**) is empty.

If you have run tests, this section contains information on your test executions.

> Notes:
>
> If you can't find your script repositories, you can refresh your script repositories to make test cases appear in folders on the **Test Cases** page. Follow these steps:
>
> 1. Go to **Configurations** > **Script Repositories**.
>
> 2. Select a script repository to go to the script repository page.

>
> 3. Click **Refresh Test Suite Collection** in the top right corner.
>
> 4. Go to **Test Management** > **Test Cases**.
>
> You can now see test cases from the script repository you have refreshed.

### View test cases uploaded to a script repository

> Notice:
>
> This feature will soon be deprecated. We encourage you to use the other supported sources.

If you upload tests as .zip file, your test cases will not be displayed on the **Test Cases** page yet.

You must execute tests on Katalon TestOps to generate the execution reports first.

After running tests, the test cases and their execution data will appear in a folder within the *Uploaded Data* folder.

## View test cases from uploaded execution data

If you upload your execution data using the frameworks we support, or upload manually to Katalon TestOps (see: [Upload JUnit and Katalon Studio Test Results to Katalon TestOps](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/testops-uploader.html)), you can also view test data on the **Test Cases** page.

Katalon TestOps supports uploading test results from the following frameworks:

* Jasmine. See: [Upload Test to Katalon TestOps via Jasmine](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/kt-upload-test-jasmine.html).

* Jest. See: [Upload Test to Katalon TestOps via Jest](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/kt-upload-test-jest.html).

* Mocha. See: [Upload Test to Katalon TestOps via Mocha](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/kt-upload-test-mocha.html).

* Pytest. See: [Upload Test to Katalon TestOps via Pytest](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/kt-upload-test-pytest.html).

After uploading the execution data, go to **Test Management** > **Test Cases** and click on the *Uploaded Data* folder.

You can see test cases and their execution data in folders inside the *Uploaded Data* folder.
