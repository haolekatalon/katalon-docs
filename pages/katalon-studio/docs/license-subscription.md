## Get a Price Quote for Annual Subscription

Katalon provides monthly and annual billing cycles. For an annual billing cycle, you can get a Price Quote before purchasing your licenses. If you choose monthly billing cycle or don't need a Price Quote, you can skip to [Purchase your Licenses](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/license-subscription.html#purchase-your-licenses).

Follow these steps to get a Price Quote and pay for the Quote:

1. Log in to [Katalon TestOps](https://testops.katalon.io/).
2. Select your desired Organization and go to **Settings > Subscription Managements**. The **Subscriptions** page appears.
3. Select **Studio Subscription**. In the **Billing Summary**, select the license type you wish to get a Quote for, then click **Get Quote**.
