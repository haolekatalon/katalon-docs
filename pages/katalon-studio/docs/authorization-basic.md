## Basic

This is the simplest authorization for a request. With basic authentication, you need to input your credentials to authenticate the request. These credentials will be encoded into the Authorization request headers. Do as follows:

1. In the **Authorization** tab of a web service request, set the **Type** as **Basic**.

2. Pass in your username and password to authenticate the request, then click on **Update to HTTP Header**. The username and password are encoded to the **Authorization** request of the **HTTP Header** tab, as you can see below.Â
