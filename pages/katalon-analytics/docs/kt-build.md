During the release cycle, you commonly need to test different builds to easily track production issues. In TestOps, the Build function allows you to associate and orchestrate the test runs relevant to each build.

## Create a build

Follow these steps:

1. Sign in to [Katalon TestOps](https://testops.katalon.io/login) and go to your Project.

2. Go to **Planning** > **Releases**.

3. Select a Release (e.g., **7.3.7**).

    The **Test Cases** page of the **7.3.7** Release appears as below.

4. Click on the **Create Build** button at the top right corner.
    
    The **Create Build** page appears.

    * **Name**: enter the Build's name.
    * **Description**: add a note about your Build.
    * **Date**: enter the creation date for this Build.

6. Click **Create**.

You have created a new Build. This Build now appears in the **Builds** section of the **7.3.7** Release.
