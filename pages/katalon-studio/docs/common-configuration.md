A CI/CD plugin helps download, deploy, and execute Katalon Studio on servers automatically.

> Katalon TestOps CI is an easier way to execute Katalon Studio tests remotely or schedule remote Katalon Studio execution. [Learn more](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/kt-remote-execution.html)

Other advantages are:

* Being quick and easy - you wonâ€™t even have to install Katalon Studio manually
* Being able to work even on machines without displays.
* Allocating an isolated virtual display for each Jenkins build increases the stability of execution.

This article will show you how to configure a CI/CD plugin.

### Download Katalon Studio version

Specify the Katalon Studio (prior to 7.0) or Katalon Runtime Engine (7.0+) version that is downloaded automatically to execute the tests.

E.g. 5.10.1. The list of all releases can be retrieved from here.

### Use pre-installed Katalon Studio

E.g. /var/lib/jenkins/Katalon_Studio_Linux_64-5.10.1.

Use this field when Katalon Studio (prior to 7.0)/Katalon Runtime Engine (7.0+) cannot be downloaded automatically (often due to network conditions).

### Command arguments

E.g. `-browserType="Chrome" -retry=0 -statusDelay=15 -testSuitePath="Test Suites/Regression Tests/All tests"`.

Please leave out `-runMode`. If not specified, `-projectPath` will be set to the current workspace directory.

Environment variables can be applied in the command arguments to parameterize the configuration with the following syntax:

* For Windows: `%<var_name>%`
* For Linux/macOS: `$var_name`

### X11 DISPLAY (for Linux)

E.g.: This value will be used as the DISPLAY environment variable. Jenkins must be allowed to connect to the display, see `xhost` if you encounter access control issues.

### Xvfb-run configuration (for Linux)

E.g.: -a -n 0 -s "-screen 0 1024x768x24".
If specified, `xvfb-run` will be used. Please make sure `Xvfb` has been installed.

**Save** the configuration after finishing.
