**July 26, 2021**

This release of Katalon TestOps comes jam-packed with multiple enterprise-grade features such as:

- Auto-distributed Execution
- View Re-run Test Results
- Similar Error Suggestion

## Auto-distributed Execution

This new feature provides testers who are leveraging [parallel execution](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/kte-whats-new-in-april-release.html) a more effective way to execute their tests faster. Auto-distributed Execution provides the following benefits:

- Minimize test execution time by allowing any active agent to pick up jobs and optimize the waiting time for each session.
- Use load balancing mechanisms to enable agents to get a new job once their resources are freed from the current one.
- Use the just-in-time (JIT) method to automatically assign jobs to an active/available agent.

## View Re-run Test Results

TestOps continues to enhance the way that test results are displayed to its users. This new feature provides users with:

- A consolidated view of all re-run tests
- Combined view of all retry attempts into one single execution report

## Similar Error Suggestion

Identifying the root cause of a failed test can be a daunting task. This new feature allows users to:

- Identify all the common errors of a failed test in a centralized view
- Save time by eliminating the need to navigate through multiple log files
- Navigate directly to the test results page from the error summary
