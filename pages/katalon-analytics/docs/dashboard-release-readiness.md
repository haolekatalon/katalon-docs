The **Release Readiness** dashboard allows you to:
* Evaluate the status of the two most recent releases.
* Oversee your release plan with reminders of the delivery date.
* Monitor productivity to see progress in development and testing.
* Highlight the total number of defects for each release.

## Insights

Production-ready for release overhauls changes during developing, testing, and deploying. Release readiness guarantees product satisfaction, which could avoid bad customer feedback that negatively impacts your business.

The **Release Readiness** dashboard ensures that all team members are on the same page and aware of the product deployment process (release timeline, changing requirements, what to be deployed after changes, and double-checking changes before deployment).

Since you have to complete all testing before releasing your software/application, release readiness lets you check if your QA and testers have done their parts to make sure the product is rolled out successfully. If not, release readiness helps you identify the following questions:

* How significant is the change that would affect the product release?

    As you see the total number of defects for each release highlighted on the dashboard, you are aware of any significant change.

* Does such change touch many other parts of the software/application?
    
    Since you can monitor productivity to see the progress in development and testing, you can assess the release status following your awareness of these changes.

* How much time does the team have to troubleshoot and make changes? Does it affect the delivery date that the **Release Readiness** dashboard highlights?

By evaluating the release status and seeing changes associated with the release, your product is well taken care of and ready for the best customer experience.

Release readiness ensures a quality-driven and customer-centric culture. With the dashboard analytics, you and your team canâ€™t possibly rush to release a product at the expense of low customer satisfaction rates.
