A Team is a group of Users working on the same Projects. A Team is created by either the Owner or Admins of an Organization.

Only Users can view and access the Team's Projects.

## Roles and permissions at the Team level

* **Owner**

If you create a new Team, you become its Owner by default.
As an Owner, you have full permission to transfer the Owner role to another team member.

* **Admin**

This role is granted by the Owner.

The Admin has similar privileges as the Owner but cannot transfer the Team ownership to an existing team member.

* **User**

This role is automatically assigned to any person accepting the invitation to join the Team.

Users can only monitor the Project's progress.

## Create a Team

Follow these steps:

1. Click on the **Settings** icon at the top right corner of TestOps homepage and choose **Team Management**.
