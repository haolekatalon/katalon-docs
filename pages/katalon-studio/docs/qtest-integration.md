### Upload test suites manually

> Notes:
> * Suppose you choose the **Create and upload** or the **Create, upload and set as default** option while registering a qTest location for a test suite. In that case, your test suite is automatically uploaded to the registered qTest location. You can skip this part.

Katalon allows you to upload a test suite or all test suites in a test suite folder to qTest.

1. Upload a test suite manually:

   > Requirements:
   > * Make sure all test suites have at least one registered qTest location.
   > * The selected test suites have not been uploaded yet.

   - To upload a test suite manually to the predefined qTest location, navigate to the **Integration** tab of the test suite. In the **List of test suite's parents**, select a qTest location, then click **Upload**.  

      <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/integrate-test-suite/image2016-11-22-143A103A48.png" width=70% alt="Upload test suites manually">

   - Alternatively, you can also right-click on the test suite to trigger its context menu. Select **qTest > Upload**.

## Map a Katalon test case to a qTest test case by database ID

> Requirements:
> * Katalon Studio version 7.9.0 onwards.
> * qTest integration enabled.
> * The Katalon test case must be located in the integrated test case folder with qTest. To learn more about integrating a test case folder with qTest, refer to step 4 in Manual Setup. See above: [Manual Setup](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/qtest-integration.html#configure-qtest-integration).

Katalon Studio provides an easy way to map a Katalon test case to an existing qTest test case. Follow these steps:

1. In qTest, you can get a qTest test case database ID in the test case URL. 

   <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/enable-qtest-integration/id.png" width=70% alt="Get qTest test case database ID in qTest">  

2. In Katalon Studio, select a test case you want to link to the above qTest test case. Add the copied value to its name in the following format: `<qTest Database ID> <Katalon test case name>`.

   <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/enable-qtest-integration/renamed.png" width=80% alt="Copy ID database in the test case">

3. Open the test case editor, select the **Integration** tab. 
4. Click **Link qTest Test Case**.  

   <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/docs/enable-qtest-integration/link.png" width=50% alt="Link qTest Test case">

5. Save your change when the test case is linked to qTest successfully.
