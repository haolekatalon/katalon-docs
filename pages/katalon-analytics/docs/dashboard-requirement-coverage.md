The **Requirement Coverage** dashboard allows you to monitor the coverage of test cases and test runs in each corresponding requirement in your project.

## Insights

Project management with Jira/Cucumber integration could not be effective if it does not allow you to centralize all Jira and BDD requirements in one single place for reports and analytics.
 
The larger a project is, the more requirements you and your team have to ensure all defects and product components are covered within the project. It also means a strong need for a heatmap incorporating all requirements while showing their statuses visibly in one central location.
 
In Katalon TestOps, the **Requirement Coverage** dashboard serves that purpose.

With one glance at the dashboard, you and your team can see a comprehensive report of your production progress, quickly spotting the requirements that need a close-up attention.  

For example, if the report is represented as follows:

* One green rectangle represents the coverage of "Requirement 1".
* One orange rectangle represents the coverage of "Requirement 2".
* The size of the green rectangle is bigger than the orange one.

The analytics offer the following information:

* There is more coverage of test cases and test runs on "Requirement 1"  than "Requirement 2".
* The quality of test cases on "Requirement 1" is better than that of "Requirement 2".
* The green color means that tests are passed, while the orange color represents failed tests. If a green rectangle is bigger than the orange one, it is a good sign. By contrast, if the orange rectangle is bigger, it signifies that there is a lot of bugs and the product is not working as expected.
