When executing tests on TestCloud in Windows with Chrome version 93.x or 94.x, users may come across the following error:

``` groovy
SessionNotCreatedException: Message: session not created
from timeout: Timed out receiving message from renderer: 600.000
```

The tests hang on launching the browser and eventually time out. This is an issue from Chrome version 93.x and 94.x that doesnâ€™t allow the ChromeDriver to start as a Windows service.

Here are two workarounds for this issue:

1. Set `--disable-gpu` for the desired capability in Chrome. For Katalon Studio users, to do so, go to **Project Settings > Desired Capabilities > Web UI > Chrome**. Click **Add**, then input as follows:

    <table width="587">
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td><strong>Name</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Type</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Value</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>args</td>
    <td>List</td>
    <td>--disable-gpu</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    With the configured desired capabilities, you can continue to work with Chrome version 93.x or 94.x

2. Downgrade to Chrome version 92.x. For Katalon Studio users, to downgrade ChromeDriver versions, you can refer to this guide here: [Update or Downgrade WebDrivers](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/update-or-downgrade-webdrivers.html#update-a-webdriver).

    You can find other ChromeDriver versions here at the ChromeDriver website: [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).
