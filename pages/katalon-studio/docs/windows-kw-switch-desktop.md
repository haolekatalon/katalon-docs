> Starting from **version 7.0.0**, Windows desktop application testing is available on Katalon Studio.

## switchToDesktop

* **Description**: Switch from the current running driver to a desktop session of the Windows Driver. This keyword initializes another Windows Driver with the `app: Root` (the whole desktop) desired capability and the same WinAppDriver URL and Proxy settings of the application driver. All of Windows built-in keywords now are manipulated by the desktop Windows Driver.
* **Keyword name**: switchToDesktop
* **Keyword syntax**: Windows.switchToDesktop()
* **Example**:

``` groovy
"Start the note pad application"
Windows.startApplication('C:\\Windows\\System32\\notepad.exe')

"Switch to control the Desktop"
Windows.switchToDesktop()
```
