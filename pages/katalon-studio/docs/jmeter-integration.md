### Manually integrate JMeter with Katalon Studio

You can integrate JMeter with Katalon Studio yourself by following this tutorial.

1. Install Gradle. Please follow the [official instruction](https://gradle.org/install/) by Gradle.

2. Pull JMeter dependency.

* Create a `build.gradle` file in your project
* Run the following command to download Jmeter dependencies: `gradle katalonCopyDependencies`.

3. Create JMeter Runner.

* Download [JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi) > Extract the bin folder in the **Include** directory of a Katalon Studio project.
* In **Include/scripts/groovy**, create `JMeterRunner` (JMeter Runner configuration class) and `KatalonSamplerClient`, which will execute Katalon test cases and return test results.

4. Once JMeter is ready, you can run your project.

* Define a custom Jmeter keyword, which will create a new JMeterRunner when the keyword is called.
* Create a test case.
* Call the Jmeter keyword then wait for the results.

You can download a [sample project](https://github.com/thongmgnguyen/katalon-jmeter-sample) using JMeter to perform API testing in Katalon Studio.
