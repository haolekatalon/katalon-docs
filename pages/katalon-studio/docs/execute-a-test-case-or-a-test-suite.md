You can run a single test case or a test suite in Katalon Studio. 

* Before executing tests, see the [supported execution environments](/display/KD/Supported+Environments).
* [Run tests in console mode](/display/KD/Console+Mode+Execution).

## Execute a Test Case or a Test Suite

To run test:

1. In **Tests Explorer**, open a test case or test suite.
2. In Katalon Toolbar, in the drop-down list of button **Run**, select an environment to run the test case. If you click on the **Run** button, the test case is executed using the default browser defined in [Execution Settings](/display/KD/Execution+Settings).

### Test Environments

In the drop-down list of button **Run**, select one of the following supported environments to run your test case or test suite:

* **Browsers**: Select one of the supported browsers (Chrome, Firefox, IE, Safari, Edge Chromium, Headless Chrome, Headless Firefox)
* **Mobile**: Select either Android or iOS to launch the connected devices. Then select a device among those listed ones.

   Before executing your Mobile test, you're required to set up the environment for mobile testing on <a href="/display/KD/Mobile+on+Windows">Windows</a> or <a href="/display/KD/Mobile+on+macOS">macOS</a> machine.

   **Troubleshooting**: If your device is not found, make sure the device's **Developer Mode** is turned on, try to unplug, and reconnect several times until you are prompted to accept/trust this device.

* **Remote**: Select a remote environment to run tests.

   You need to set up a default configuration for the remote environment in Project Settings. Refer to&nbsp;<a href="/display/KD/Introduction+to+Desired+Capabilities">Introduction to Desired Capabilities</a>&nbsp;for more details.

* **Custom**: Select it from the drop-down list when you have already set up a custom environment.

   Refer to&nbsp;<a class="external-link" href="/x/cgFO#ExecutionSettings-CustomExecution" rel="nofollow">Custom Execution</a>&nbsp;for preparing a remote environment in Project Settings. 

### Job Progress

The **Job Progress** is triggered automatically to show the progress while your test case or test suite is being executed.

### Troubleshooting

Some factors can affect your execution:

* [Failure Handling](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/failure-handling.html)
* [Test Listeners](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/fixtures-listeners.html#test-listeners-test-hooks)
* [Setup/Teardown Test Case/Suite](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/fixtures-listeners.html)

You can also refer to this [document](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-studio/docs/troubleshoot-common-execution-exceptions-web-test.html) for troubleshooting issues relating to web test execution.

## Debug a test case

Creating automation test cases is a repetitive task that requires a lot of editing and re-running test cases. In many automation tools, when a test case fails and you make certain changes to the script, you usually have to execute the whole script all over again to make sure the test is executed as expected.

To save your precious time from tedious repetitive re-running all unnecessary steps for debugging and to make debugging easier, Katalon Studio provides the following utilities:

* Debug: Run from here
* Debug: Enable/Disable steps
* Debug mode
* Debug from here

**Requirements**

* An active Katalon Studio Enterprise license

### Debug: Run from here

With this feature, you can resume the existing execution quickly. Katalon Studio currently supports **Run from here** with **Chrome, Firefox, and Edge Chromium** (Edge Chromium is supported in v7.3 and later) only. To use it, from the [Manual view](/display/KD/Manual+View) of a test case:

1. Start a browser with the `Open Browser` step, or you must have a currently running browser.
2. Make sure this browser's session is NOT terminated when the execution finishes (Go to **Project/Settings/Execution** and uncheck the **Terminate...** options in **Post-Execution Options** based on your testing needs)

3. In the Manual view of the test case, right-click on a step, select **Run from here** and select one of the **currently running** browser instances to execute your test.

   > If there are no running browser instances that are previously launched in Katalon Studio, **Run from here** is disabled.

### Debug: Enable or Disable steps

Katalon Studio allows you to enable or disable one or more test steps before executing the test case to skip unwanted steps during execution. You can use the provided keyboard shortcuts to perform the actions.

* For Windows:  **Ctrl+D** (disable) and **Ctrl+E** (enable) on selected steps.
* For macOS: **command+/** (disable) and **option+command+/**

### Debug mode

The Debug mode is designed to make debugging easy to use, allowing investigating the root causes more quickly. The following steps present how to debug a test case:

1. Open a test case and switch to the **Script** view.
   
      <img src="https://github.com/katalon-studio/docs-images/raw/master/katalon-studio/tutorials/debugging_test_case/Script-view.png" width=30% alt="Script view Katalon Studio">

2. Double-click on the leftmost side of the script editor to mark a breakpoint. A breakpoint is where Katalon Studio pauses the test execution for you to start debugging.

3. Choose a browser for **Debug** from the main toolbar.

4. Confirm (select **Yes**) when being asked to display the **Debug** perspective.

5. The **Debug** perspective provides convenient options for debugging purposes. You can:

   * Navigate execution using commands from the debug toolbar

### Debug from here

> Introduced in version **7.5.5**.

To use **Debug from here** with **Chrome, Firefox, or Edge Chromium**, do as follows:

1. Start a browser with the `Open Browser` step, or you must have a currently running browser
2. Make sure this browser's session is NOT terminated when the execution finishes (Go to **Project/Settings/Execution** and uncheck the **Terminate...** options in **Post-Execution Options** based on your testing needs)

4. Switch to the test case's **Manual** view, right-click on a step, select **Debug from here** and select one of the **currently running** browser instances to execute your test.

   > If there are no running browser instances that are previously launched in Katalon Studio, **Debug from here...** is disabled.
