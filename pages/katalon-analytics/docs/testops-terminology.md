## TestOps Terminology

**<details><summary>Agent</summary>**
Connects a local machine to the TestOps servers for test executions.
</details>

**<details><summary>API performance anomalies</summary>**
Identify web services that take more/less time to respond than usual by applying the local outlier factor (LOF) on 30 latest execution requests.
</details>

**<details><summary>Assertions</summary>**
Determine whether the automated test case succeeds or not.

Katalon TestOps provides you with a specific view of assertions in each test case to evaluate the quality of test cases and ensure your tested application/software is working correctly.

Assertions help to check whether a condition is true (e.g., whether labels, data, API responses are rendered correctly).
</details>

**<details><summary>BDD Test Result</summary>**
Represents the result of a test following the Behavior Driven Development (BDD) Framework.

In Katalon TestOps, the Features of BDD tests are displayed as Requirements, while Scenarios are displayed as Test Cases.
</details>

**<details><summary>Build</summary>**
Represents a group of features/tasks in a release, used for management or testing purposes.

In Katalon TestOps, a build can consist of one or more test cases.

When users map a test result to a build, the test result is automatically mapped to the corresponding release. However, if users map a test result to a release, the test result is not mapped to any specific build.
</details>

**<details><summary>Build Label</summary>**
Represents a piece of code committed to the source code
</details>

**<details><summary>Defect</summary>**
Identifies a failed test run to link the test result to a Jira issue (Jira bug).

**<details><summary>Interval (Trigger)</summary>**
A time period between each scheduled execution.

In Katalon TestOps, the Interval Unit values are Minute, Hour, Day, Week. For example, if you set Interval Unit as Hour, Interval as 5, it means the execution is scheduled for every 5 hours.
</details>

**<details><summary>Key (Jira)</summary>**
Represents the ID of a Jira issue you have linked a test case/test result to.

In Katalon TestOps, you link a test case to Jira Requirements and link a test result (if the test run fails) to a Jira Defect.
