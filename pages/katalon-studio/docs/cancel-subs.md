You can cancel your Katalon license subscription at any time. This action will turn off the auto-renewal of your license subscription on the next billing cycle.

Subscription cancellation does NOT issue a refund. You can continue using the remaining subscription you have already purchased.

Only the Organization Owner and Admins can cancel a subscription.

After the cancellation, the subscription remains **active** until the end of the current billing period. On the next billing date, its status becomes **terminated**.

To cancel your subscription, follow these steps:

1. Log in to [Katalon TestOps](https://testops.katalon.io/).
2. Select your **Organization**.
3. Go to **Settings > Subscriptions Management > Studio Subscriptions**.
4. On the top right corner of the **Subscription** view, click **Edit Subscription**

5. Find the license you wish to cancel, then click **Cancel**. The **Cancel Subscription** dialog appears. To confirm your action, click **OK**.
