You can execute Test Runs one time or regularly by configuring a schedule for Test Runs. See: [Schedule Test Runs](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/create-plan.html).

You can also execute Test Runs manually by following these steps:

1. Go to your Project > **Test Execution** > **Test Run List**.

2. Click on the *Run* icon for manual execution.

## View the status of Test Runs

After executing Test Runs, go to **Test Execution**, then select **Test Run Calendar** to check their status in a calendar view.

Click on a Test Run on the calendar to see its summary.

If a Test belongs to a Test Suite, you can also see a summary of the Test Suite here.
