This article introduces you to the key metrics and usage quotas in Katalon TestCloud.

## Key metrics

Katalon TestCloud has three key metrics:

* **Expiry date**: The determined date when your TestCloud plan ends.
* **Number of sessions**: The maximum number of parallel test executions.

## Usage quota

Katalon TestCloud has two main packages:

* TestCloud Trial.
* TestCloud Per Session.

To learn more about each package, you can refer to this document: [TestCloud pricing and feature comparisons](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-testcloud/docs/tc-subscription-plans.html).
### TestCloud Trial

All users who belong to a TestOps organization can use TestCloud for free with the **free trial** package. If you exceed the supported quota, you need to subscribe to TestCloud Per Session to continue testing on TestCloud. 

### TestCloud Per Session

The Per Session plan gives you unlimited testing minutes per session. One session allows you to run one sequence of tests, for as long as you need. The number of sessions you purchase is the maximum number of parallel tests you can execute. You can use the purchased number of sessions as many times as you want within your billing cycle. 

For example, if you purchase 3 sessions, you will have 3 parallel test executions. You can execute 3 parallel tests at maximum for as long as you need, as many times as you want within your billing cycle.
