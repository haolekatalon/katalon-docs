If you want to make a list of custom desired capabilities for some environments, you can use the **Custom** settings in desired capabilities.

This article shows you how to configure custom capabilities and where they are saved.
## Custom desired capabilities

To create a custom execution with desired capabilities, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Project > Settings > Desired Capabilities > Custom**. Click **Add** on the command toolbar to add a custom profile.
