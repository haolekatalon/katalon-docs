The TestOps Dashboard module provides you with an overview of recent test activities, upcoming releases, productivity, quality of test cases, platform coverage, requirement coverage, and local test environments.

This module provides real-time data on your testing activities, gathered in seven dashboards. The module helps drive insights and assist you in decision-making.

The seven dashboards include:
* **Test Activities**: all testing activities categorized into a daily/weekly/monthly report. See: [Test Activities Dashboard](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/dashboard-test-activities.html).

* **Release Readiness**: how ready your release is. See: [Release Readiness Dashboard](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/dashboard-release-readiness.html).

* **Productivity**: tracks productivity metrics such as the number of test cases created over time. See: [Productivity Dashboard](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/dashboard-productivity.html).

* **Quality**: the test quality based on Flakiness Test Distribution (the distribution of test cases by their flakiness probability). See: [Quality Dashboard](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/dashboard-quality.html).

* **Platform Coverage**: the coverage of test runs or test results executed in corresponding environments/platforms. See: [Platform Coverage Dashboard](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/dashboard-platform-coverage.html).

* **Requirement Coverage**: the scope of test cases and test runs based on related requirements (Jira and BDD). See: [Requirement Coverage Dashboard](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/dashboard-requirement-coverage.html).

* **Local Test Environment**: the number of active and inactive local test environments. See: [Local Test Environment Dashboard](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/dashboard-local-test-environment.html).
